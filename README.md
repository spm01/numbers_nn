# numbers_nn

This is my capstone project for the year! I focused on creating a small scale neural network to identify numbers from a database. 

This was coded in Python with guidance from many sources, but eventually ended up being a successful project with ~95% accuracy in predictions! (Pretty good for a first time!)

I'm always looking for ways to improve my methods or code, so feel free to drop me a line!
